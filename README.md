An app for locating nearby mosques in Singapore and tracking prayer times 

I will do a write-up on my journey in learning how to assemble this app. The catch is I've only very little formal classes.
So this write-up will be entirely based on a self-teaching/self-learning point-of-view. I just thought it would be interesting
to be in the mind of a rookie and see how he interacts and perceives new things.
