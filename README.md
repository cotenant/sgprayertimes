I will write about my journey in learning how to assemble this app. Coming from a non-coding background—well almost*, I thought it would be fun to share about the ways I approach learning, the mistakes I’ve made and what I’ve learned in the process of achieving that very goal of: Getting to know how to code and then putting it into practice. 
 
*I’ve had some classes in school but they were only introductory and didn't last. I’d say what got me ahead were mostly online tutorials, youtube videos and also CS50’s “Intro to compSci” course which I have yet to complete.
